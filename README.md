# shortest_path_dijkstras-algorithm

Find the shortest path between the source vertex and other vertices in a directed graph.
Each edge must have a non negative length/weights or else dijkstra's algorithm will not work.
The algorithum is a special kind Breath First Search that favours edges with smaller weights instead of choosing by random.
